This code was donated to Knight Lab, and we do not have extensive PHP development experience, so fixes and changes happens slowly at best. We welcome contributions from our community.

One of those contributions was guidance to use standard PHP code formatter/linter. If you want to contribute to this repository, please install it and use it before submitting a pull request.

* install [`composer`](https://getcomposer.org/) (a PHP dependency manager)
* run `composer install`
* run  `./vendor/bin/phpcbf` to format
* run `./vendor/bin/phpcs` to lint

We were also advised that the [Query Monitor](https://querymonitor.com/) plugin can be quite useful for PHP development.
