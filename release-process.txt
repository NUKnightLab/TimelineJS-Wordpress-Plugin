Until we can figure out how to automate it, be sure to follow these steps to update the WP plugin for a TimelineJS update. Each separate step may not always apply, so use your judgment.

1. in the TimelineJS3 project, run 'fab stage_wp' (this copies the latest TimelineJS into this repository)

2. Update the list of available languages. Should be as simple as copy/paste the menu <option> items from
		TimelineJS3/website/templates/_make.html (DON'T copy the <select> because the values of the 'id' attribute are different.)
	to
		TimelineJS-Wordpress-Plugin/knightlab-timeline.php

Languages are also listed in readme.txt so add them there too.

3. Increment the Version number in the knightlab-timeline.php and the Stable Tag in readme.txt to the same version.
		Note: When updating from a TimelineJS release, append a 0 to the end of the version number. Otherwise, increment normally (2.28.1.0 --> 2.28.1.1)
			Ex. TimelineJS version is 2.28.1 turns into 2.28.1.0 (used to separate the TimelineJS versioning from the WP Plugin version)

4. Execute deploy.sh to deploy changes to the Wordpress SVN
* update readme.txt with release notes (as we develop style, document that explicitly right in this here file)

* (as we go through the process of updating the WP repository, document details here)
